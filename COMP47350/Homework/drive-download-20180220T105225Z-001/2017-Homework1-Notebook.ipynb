    "\n",
    "This homework focuses on data understanding and preparation for a particular problem and dataset.\n",
    "The problem and data come from a mobile phone company concerned with reducing customer churn. Customer churn happens when a customer switches mobile operator. The company wants to use the data collected about their customers to build a data analytics solution for customer churn prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each student will work with a different subset of the data. The CSV file is named using the format: **CustomerChurn-[your-student-number].csv**, e.g., **CustomerChurn-12345678.csv** is the data file for a student with number 12345678. You need to work with the CSV file corresponding to your student number. The CSV file contains data describing each customer and whether the customer churned (last column in the CSV). There are 3 parts for this homework. Each part has an indicative maximum percentage given in brackets, e.g., part (1) has a maximum of 50% shown as [50].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(1). [50] Prepare a data quality report for the CSV file. Below you have a set of guideline steps to help you in this process.\n",
    "    - Check how many rows and columns your CSV has.\n",
    "    - Print the first and the last 5 rows.\n",
    "    - Convert the features to their appropriate data types (e.g., decide which features are more appropriate as \n",
    "    continuos and which ones as categorical types). \n",
    "    - Drop duplicate rows and columns, if any.\n",
    "    - Drop constant columns, if any.\n",
    "    - Save your updated/cleaned data frame to a new csv file.\n",
    "  \n",
    "    For the updated CSV and data frame (after column/row removal):\n",
    "    - Prepare a table with descriptive statistics for all the continuous features.\n",
    "    - Prepare a table with descriptive statistics for all the categorical features.\n",
    "    - Plot histograms for all the continuous features.\n",
    "    - Plot box plots for all the continuous features.\n",
    "    - Plot bar plots for all the categorical features.\n",
    "    - Discuss your initial findings.\n",
    "    - Save the initial discussion of your findings into a single data quality report PDF \n",
    "    file.   \n",
    "\n",
    "(2). [30] Prepare a data quality plan for the cleaned CSV file (look for the type of problems we discussed in the lecture).\n",
    "    - Mark down all the features where there are potential problems or data quality issues.\n",
    "    - Propose solutions to deal with the problems identified. Explain why did you choose one solution over \n",
    "    potentially many other.\n",
    "    - Apply your solutions to obtain a new CSV file where the identified data quality issues were addressed. \n",
    "    - Save the new CSV file with a self explanatory name. Save the data quality plan to a single PDF file (as a \n",
    "    table or a structured text).\n",
    "        \n",
    "(3). [20] Exploring relationships between feature pairs:\n",
    "    - Choose a subset of features you find promising and plot pairwise feature interactions (e.g., \n",
    "    continuous-continuous feature plot or continuous-categorical plots or correlation plots). Explain your choices.\n",
    "    - Discuss your findings from the plots above. Do you find any features or feature combinations that are \n",
    "    indicative of the target outcome (i.e., churn)? Explain in plain words (a short paragraph) the story of your\n",
    "    findings so far.\n"
